# India-Stock-Price-Prediction-Models

### Motivation for this project

We have seen movies in which stock traders are buying thousands of hot stock shares or dumping shares of plummeting stock. We have seen many commercials for brokerage firms that claim to have exciting prospects and strong portfolios. 
 
So, we are interesting how these traders and firms predict stock price and the best timing to sell the stock? 
 
There is no magical way to predict the stock market. However, we can predict the share prices by studying the historical trends by selecting the appropriate Machine learning model. 
 
As you may aware that the idea of using machine learning to predict stock prices is not entirely new. Therefore, our observation does not aim to make groundbreaking discoveries but instead to add to growing existing research.
